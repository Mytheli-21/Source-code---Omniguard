Phishing attacks delivered through WhatsApp messages, email communication, and malicious websites pose a significant threat to digital security, often resulting in data theft, financial fraud, and identity compromise. The absence of real-time protection mechanisms and effective user awareness tools across multiple communication channels further increases user vulnerability. To address these challenges, this paper presents Omni Guard, an AI-powered phishing detection and prevention system designed to provide instant and unified protection across WhatsApp, email, and web browsing environments. The proposed system employs advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, including transformer-based Natural Language Processing models and URL behavior analysis, to detect and classify phishing content in real time. Omni Guard performs continuous message inspection, suspicious link analysis, and dynamic website evaluation to automatically block high-risk threats. A hybrid decision engine with severity scoring and user alert mechanisms ensures accurate detection and informed user responses, while secure logging and a scalable architecture support continuous monitoring, system reliability, and future expansion.
